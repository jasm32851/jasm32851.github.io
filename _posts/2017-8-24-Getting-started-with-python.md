## Downloading Python
The easiest way to get started with Python is to use a distribution like
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). This allows you to get Python
and all of the Python packages that we'll need for this class at once. The
general installation instructions can be found
[here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/). If you are in CHEM 5581:
__MAKE SURE YOU GET PYTHON 2.7!__

## Editing scripts
Editing scripts can be done in any basic text editor (your computer should come
with one). If you want more flexibility I would suggest
[Atom Editor](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

## Running scripts
# Mac OSx/ Linux
To run a script:
```sh
python ~/Desktop/my_python_script.py
```

# Windows:
To run a script
```sh
:\Users\YOUR_Username\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\Users\Username\Desktop\my_python_script.py
```
