Over the years, I've spent a lot of time looking for ways to find funding and it's been a difficult because there are a lot of lists, but none of them seem complete (this one isn't either). But I think that this list is a good start for students studying theoretical chemistry or physics. If you know any ones that I missed, let me know!
