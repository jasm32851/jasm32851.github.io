        Research Assistant/Doctoral Candidate (Fall 2016 - Present)
        <p>
          Our group is interested in developing fast and accurate methods to compute the electronic structure of highly multireference molecules. I'm currently working on the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01028">Semistochastic Heatbath Configuration Interaction</a> (SHCI) project to connect this algorithm with the <a href="https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf">PySCF</a> Quantum Chemistry package. Our group has implemented the SHCI algorithm in the <a href = "https://sanshar.github.io/Dice/">Dice</a> package and in the future, I hope to use Dice/PySCF to build potential energy surfaces and use these to study the surface hopping dynamics of metal centers found in biological molecules.

        Research Assistant (Fall 2014 - Fall 2016)
        <p>
          Studied the effect of solvation on water oxidation catalysts and inorganic metal complexes using UV and Visible laser spectroscopies. During my time in the group, I modified the existing reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer to allow the use of infrared as well as UV/Visible light to study these ionic species.

        Head Teaching Assistant (Spring 2016)
        <p>
          In addition to teaching General Chemistry 2 laboratories and small group activities, I worked closely with the instructors of the course to prepare the laboratory experiments and materials. Every week I led meetings where I introduced the material for the coming week to my fellow teaching assistants (TAs) and helped younger TAs improve their teaching abilities.

        Teaching Assistant (Fall 2014 - Fall 2015)
        <p>
          I taught General Chemistry laboratory and small group activities for 80 students a semester. During this time, I met with other TAs and the laboratory instructor regularly to discuss and improve the pedagogy of the course.
